# Text_Summarization
This project lets you quickly summarize long documents using OpenAI's language models. You can upload PDFs and get summaries through a user-friendly web app built with Streamlit.
# Usage
1. Clone the repo and install the required packages:
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd <your-repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'

3. Run the app:
streamlit run summarization.ipynb

After running the app, you can upload a document like a research paper or an article in PDF format. The model will then generate a summary based on the content of the uploaded document, which will appear on the web interface.
